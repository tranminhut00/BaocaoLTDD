# Android Notes App

A simple short notes app for Android devices.

## Features

This app uses a very native model of code in android studio and uses SharedPreferences for saving and retrieving the Notes even if the app gets closed or re-opened. No server config like Firebase is used in this project only Native code is being used. Simply open this project on Android Studio and make it up and running.
